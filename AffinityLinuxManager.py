"""Affinity on Linux Manager -- several Affinity prefixes, tracked.

AffinityOnLinux installs one Affinity, into ~/.AffinityLinux, and remembers one
custom location. That is the right shape for most people and the wrong shape as
soon as you need two: a working install you cannot afford to break, and a new
release to try.

This manages the set. It does not install anything itself -- it runs the
AffinityOnLinux installer against a prefix you name, which is the only part
that was missing.
