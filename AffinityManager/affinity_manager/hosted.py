"""The AffinityOnLinux installer, hosted as a page of the manager window.

Not launched as a child process any more. The manager is the main window and
Setup is a state of it, which means the installer's window has to stop being a
window: reparented into the manager's QStackedWidget it keeps its layout and
loses its title bar, its own size constraints and its independent lifetime.

Four things follow from that, and each is handled here rather than upstream,
because upstream is still a single file that people run with `curl | python3`
and it has to keep working that way.

  * Size. The constructor sets a minimum of half the screen, which is right for
    a window of its own and would make the manager unresizable. Cleared after
    construction, and the page scrolls, so a tall installer UI stays reachable
    in a short window.

  * Which prefix. AFFINITY_INSTALL_DIR is read once, in the constructor. As a
    child process that was the child's environment; here it is ours, so it is
    set for the length of the construction and put back afterwards -- and the
    directory the window settled on is checked against the one asked for before
    the page is shown at all. An installer pointed at the wrong prefix is the
    failure this whole project exists to prevent.

  * Time. Three deferred tasks are scheduled 50ms, 500ms and 700ms after the
    constructor returns: background probing, a DXVK/vkd3d check, and a donation
    dialog. Hosted, the first is fine, the second belongs to entering the page
    rather than to building it, and the third is a modal appearing over a
    manager the user did not ask a question of.

  * One operation at a time. The installer's own start_operation /
    end_operation are the choke point -- not every button click is an operation,
    and a theme toggle must not be refused -- so the lock is taken and given up
    there.

    And those run on the installer's own worker threads.
    _one_click_setup_thread's first statement is a start_operation, so the
    claim has to be thread-safe and answer immediately, while everything it
    causes to be painted has to happen on the GUI thread. The two halves are
    split accordingly: the claim is taken where the call lands, and a signal
    carries the rest across.

    They also nest, and not in a balanced way -- one installer method has one
    start_operation and eleven end_operations -- so the lock is held for the
    page rather than counted, and given up after a short settle that any
    further start_operation cancels. Releasing on the first end_operation
    would open the lock between the steps of a One-Click Full Setup.
