"""The shipped tree names only public sources and no personal details.

The same commit is tried on a private server, then on a public staging
branch, then published; where it was fetched from is decided by the URL it was
started with (see run.py), never by the code. So nothing in the tree may name
the private server, and nothing may carry a personal address or an AI
co-author line -- the files are published as they are.

Scans the manager and, when it sits inside the installer's repository as
AffinityManager/, that whole repository.
