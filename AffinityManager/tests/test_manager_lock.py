"""The window's half of the operation lock.

oplock itself is tested in test_oplock.py. What is tested here is the wiring:
that the manager's own operations actually go through the lock, that the
watchdog tick releases work which stopped without saying so, and that a
refusal or a hand release leaves the window in a coherent state.

The `window` fixture (conftest.py) is a ManagerWindow with the Qt removed --
real registry, real lock, real _busy_* methods.
