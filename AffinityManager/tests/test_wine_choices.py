"""Every Wine version the installer offers can actually be chosen.

The installer asks "Choose Wine Version" in three places, each with its own
list of labels and its own label -> version mapping. A Wine question is never
shown as those buttons, though: _show_question_dialog_safe swaps it for a
radio-button dialog with labels of its own, and whatever label that dialog
returns is what the mapping sees.

The two drifted apart once. 11.18 was added to the three lists and the 11.16
label renamed, but not in the radio dialog -- so the manager offered 11.16
only, and choosing it returned the old label, which no mapping recognised:
"Wine setup cancelled". This reads the installer's source and checks the
pieces against each other.
