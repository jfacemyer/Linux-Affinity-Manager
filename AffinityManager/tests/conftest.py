"""A ManagerWindow with the Qt taken out.

Several things worth testing hang off _busy_start / _busy_step / _busy_done --
the durable operation record, and the operation lock -- and all of them are
bookkeeping rather than painting. Building the real window to reach them would
mean probing the real home directory and starting real threads, so the methods
are bound to a stand-in instead: real code, real registry, real lock, stubs
only where a widget would be.
