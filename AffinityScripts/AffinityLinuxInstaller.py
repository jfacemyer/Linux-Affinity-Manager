    The documented install is `curl ... | python3`, and there __file__ is not a

    used here before were wrong:

      Path(__file__).parent          ->  Path(".")  -- the CURRENT DIRECTORY
      Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent  ->  the parent of it

    which means the fast paths looked for icons, MIME definitions and
    affinity-on-linux.exe in whatever directory the user happened to be
    standing in when they ran the pipe. An `icons/` folder there was picked up
    as if it were this project's; an `AffinityHandler/affinity-on-linux.exe`
    there was copied into the prefix and run. The `except NameError` guards
    written to cover the piped case never fired, because there is no NameError
    to catch.

    So the test is not "is __file__ defined" but "is it a file". And being a
    file is not enough either: the documented alternative to the pipe is
    `curl ... -o install.py && python3 install.py`, which people run from
    ~/Downloads -- and then checkout_root() would be the home directory, so

# ── Font registrations ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Found 2026-10-01, after a fresh prefix drew Affinity's bold UI text in Arial
# Narrow and Microsoft Yahei. The core fonts winetricks installs (Tahoma Bold,
# Arial, Verdana...) were on disk in windows\Fonts, but their registrations had
# gone from the 64-bit Fonts keys -- the ones a 64-bit Affinity reads. winetricks
# wrote them correctly; a later Wine startup's font re-sync dropped them, and the
# exact trigger was not reproduced. And Microsoft Yahei was registered from
# *another* Wine's font folder -- wine-tkg's, or the distro Wine's in
# /usr/share/wine -- because winetricks runs under wine-tkg, which looks for
# Wine's own fonts there.
#
# So rather than chase every way registrations can drift, the result is checked
# at the end of an install (and on request from the manager) and put right:
#   - every font file in the prefix's windows\Fonts is registered;
#   - registrations pointing into some other Wine's share/wine/fonts are removed.
# Host fonts (/usr/share/fonts, ~/.fonts) are Wine's normal integration and are
# left alone. Nothing points outside the prefix that did not already.

        Without it Affinity starts normally but silently ignores a document

        opens. It is the WinRT interop facade that supplies AsTask(), which
        Affinity awaits on SharedStorageAccessManager.RedeemTokenForFileAsync().

        It is missing by design, not by a broken install: the assembly ships
        inside the .NET Framework 4.8 redistributable, but only in the Windows
        8/10 payload cabs. On Windows 7 there is no WinRT, so the installer
        correctly skips it -- and winetricks' dotnet verbs set the prefix to
        win7, because on a real Windows 8+ the standalone installer refuses to
        run at all. Re-running it with the prefix reporting Windows 10 does not
        help either: it detects 4.8 and exits without doing anything. Extracting
        the file is the way.

        It must go in the GAC. Assemblies signed with the ECMA pseudo key carry
        no real signature and are trusted only because the GAC is trusted; from
        an application directory the CLR rejects the genuine file with

    "winedevice" and "wineserver" with no scoping at all. `-f` matches the whole
    command line, machine-wide, so opening the installer SIGKILLed the wineserver
    of every Wine prefix on the system -- and killing a wineserver takes every
    process it serves with it. On a machine with Affinity open in another prefix
    that meant the session and whatever was unsaved in it, before the window had
    even appeared, and with no way to opt out: this runs before any directory is
    chosen, so --install-dir could not protect you.

    Now each candidate has to name the target prefix in its own environment, and
    if the target prefix has a live Affinity in it nothing is killed at all --
    the point is to clear a stall, not to end a session.

    Returns the lines it would have printed, so a caller that is not a terminal
    can put them where its user will see them. main() prints them; the manager
    puts them in that prefix's log. It used to print unconditionally, which
    meant the hosted installer had to redirect sys.stdout -- process-wide, and
    therefore capturing whatever other threads happened to write at the same
    moment."""
