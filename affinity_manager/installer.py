"""Finding and driving AffinityOnLinux's installer.

The manager does not install anything itself. Installing Affinity under Wine is
a long, distro-specific job that AffinityOnLinux already does, and a second
implementation would drift from it. What the manager adds is which prefix, and
which build.

This needs an installer that understands AFFINITY_INSTALL_DIR. Older copies
ignore it and would install into ~/.AffinityLinux instead -- silently taking
over the user's working prefix -- so that is checked for before launching
rather than discovered afterwards.
