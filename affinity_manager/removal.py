"""Removing a prefix: everything it put on the host, itemised.

Removal used to be `shutil.rmtree(path)` and dropping the registry row. The
menu entry, the MIME package, the icon and the document defaults were all left
behind -- so deleting a prefix left a menu entry that launched nothing and, if
that prefix held the document association, double-clicking an .afphoto did
nothing at all with no indication why.

Same shape as maintenance.Plan: computed, shown, and only then executed. Every
row says what it is, where it is, how big it is, and why it is proposed. **The
confirmation is the list, not a yes/no on a summary** -- a summary is where
"and 4 other items" hides the one you would have objected to.

Two defaults are deliberate and are not symmetrical with the rest:

  settings-backup   unticked. Losing the backups of a thing along with the
                    thing is the wrong default, and they are kilobytes.
  foreign           not offered at all. Anything without our marker belongs to
                    somebody else -- AffinityOnLinux's own Affinity.desktop
                    lands here by design -- and is listed as left alone so the
                    plan can say what it did not do.
