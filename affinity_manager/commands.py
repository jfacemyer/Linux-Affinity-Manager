"""Every way a given prefix can be run, as a command you can copy or execute.

A prefix is not one configuration. It usually holds several Wine builds, and
Affinity can be started through the plugin hook, directly, or through the
file-manager handler -- each of which behaves differently and is the right
answer to a different question. Working out the incantation by hand, correctly,
every time is how people end up running the wrong Wine and drawing conclusions
from it.

Each entry carries both an argv/env pair for running and a ready-to-paste shell
line, built from the same data so the thing you copy is the thing that runs.
