"""Load AffinityOnLinux's installer as a module, instead of copying it.

The manager needs three things from the installer: its look, its widgets, and
eventually the installer window itself. Until now it had the first two as
`aol_ui.py` -- 1,410 lines extracted verbatim with `ast.get_source_segment` --
which worked and could go stale silently the moment upstream touched a
stylesheet.

Importing it is possible because of an asymmetry worth stating plainly. The
installer must stay a single file: its documented install is
`curl ... | python3`, so it can never import a sibling. The manager has no such
constraint, and is never piped. So the dependency can only point one way, and
that way happens to be the useful one.

Importing is safe, and that was measured rather than assumed: every column-zero
statement in those 19,000 lines is an import, a def, a class, the PyQt6
try/except, or the `if __name__ == "__main__"` guard. Loading it starts no GUI,
no threads and no probing, and takes about 0.05s. `SystemExit` is caught anyway
-- the file calls `sys.exit(1)` at module level when PyQt6 is missing, and the
manager should report that rather than vanish with it.
