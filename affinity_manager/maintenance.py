"""Copying a prefix, and clearing out what an install leaves behind.

Two operations that are easy to get dangerously wrong by hand:

* **Clone.** A prefix is mostly self-contained -- `dosdevices/c:` is relative,
  and the registry carries no absolute path to the prefix itself -- but it does
  hold symlinks, and a naive copy either dereferences them (turning a 700 MB
  symlinked Wine build into 700 MB of duplicate) or leaves them pointing back
  into the original, so the copy quietly writes into the prefix it was supposed
  to protect.

* **Clean.** AffinityOnLinux unpacks Wine into the prefix and does not remove
  the archive, and every rebuild leaves the previous build beside the new one.
  A prefix accumulates gigabytes of Wine builds it will never run again. The
  risk is deleting the build it *is* running, or the one a symlink names.

Everything here reports before it acts. `cleanable()` and `plan_clone()` return
what would happen; nothing is removed or written until `clean()` or `clone()` is
called with that plan.
