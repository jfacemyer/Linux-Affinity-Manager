"""The record of which prefixes this manager knows about.

Everything sits under one base directory that the user picks:

    <base>/Manager/prefixes.json    the registry
    <base>/AffinityLinux_2026-09-15_01/   a managed prefix
    <base>/My_Test_Build/                 another

The base directory is the one thing that cannot live inside itself, so it is
remembered in ~/.config/AffinityLinuxManager/base_dir -- the same problem, and
the same answer, as AffinityOnLinux's own install_location file.

The registry is deliberately not the source of truth about a prefix's contents.
What Affinity is installed, which Wine it has, whether it is running: all of
that is read off the filesystem when asked (see probe.py). The registry records
only what cannot be discovered -- that a directory is managed at all, what it
is called, and what it was created from.
